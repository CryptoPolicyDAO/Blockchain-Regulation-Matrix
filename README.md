# BlockhainRegulationMatrix
The regulatory environment of the blockchain is an ever-evolving set of constraints on crypto and its mass-adoption unintentionally set by naive politicians. Our goal here is to break-down the semantics of the blockchain in a manner a politician can understand so that they the proper legislative actions can be taken. 

This regulation matrix is divided into two sections: decentralization and centralization. The intent is to unerstand the limitiations of our own technology so that we can build in a manner that is consistent with technological development and innovation, without sacrificing anything - whether its our privacy or our ability to use the new technology. 

This document should be considered a live document that is always needing to be updated by everyone, but should likely be duplicated and maintained on a per country basis.
