## The Blockchain Regulation Matrix

### Purpose and Objective
1. To create a matrix of the blockchain stack that outlines the rationale to regulate the blockchain stack in regards to centralized and decentralized protocols.
2. To highlight areas of concern for the Howie test and whether or not it can have any weight for a token being a security or commodity.
3. Though the most important goel is to identify areas where blockchain technology can be built that will fulfil the ethos of the blockchain while remaining regulatory compliant.

The Blockchain Regulation Matrix (BRM) is made up of the stack of technology and resources that is used to create the blockchain and anything built on it.
The BRM first breaks down the blockchain stack into two categories, centralized and decentralized and then each category responds to a set of questions for each layer
of the blockchain stack.

  ### The Bockchain Stack is defined as the layers utilized during the course of a transaction from electricity to end-user:
  
  - Electricity
  - Settlement Layer
  - Node / Validator
  - Consensus Layer
      - Computation Intensive Based
      - Capabilities Based
      - Voting Based
  - Transaction Layer
  - On-chain Data Storage
  - Asset Layer
      - Stablecoins
      - Fungible Tokens (erc20, etc)
      - Non-Fungible Tokens (erc721)
  - Exchange Layer
  - Protocol Layer
  - Application Layer
  - IPFS (if used)
  - Internet Browser
  - Developer
  - Programming Langauge Auditor
  - DeFi Architecture Security

Within each layer, are the following categories to be responded to and filled in by us and anyone who wants to contribute to Crypto Policy DAO.
  - Government Concerns
  - Consumer Risks
  - Cons to Over-regulation
  - Cons to lack of regulation
  - Does blockchain technology currently exist to fulfill these obligations, and if so, what is it?
